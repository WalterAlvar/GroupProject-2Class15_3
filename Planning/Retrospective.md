# 7. Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

The team has either finished the project ahead of time, or the deadline has arrived and we're still not finished. No problem either way!

A retrospective is meant for **looking back** at how the project went and learning what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a great retrospective is still a success.

## Strategy vs. Board

Take some time as a group to compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board.

#### - What parts of your plan went as expected?
Those planned more carefully, and those assigned directly to someone

#### - What parts of your plan did not work out?
Its been difficult to communicate more effectively, sometime we take 2 hours just for identify a small thing.
#### - Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
Of course, many things stays very basics.
And we need to assign most efficiently and profit each team mate capacity.
#### - Or remove extra steps?
Yes, we need to arrive to the Daily meeting with our own task already done, and with clear new proposal.
## The Four Points

The group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three questions. We can have more than one answer! 
- **Stop Doing**:   
  - Having meetings with no plan to do, and without a time settled.

- **Continue Doing**:   
  - Keep daily **communication** with the whole team. We can delegate someone for this matter. 

  - Help our team mates to improve technical skills.
- **Start Doing**:  
  - Assign task directly to one or two members per task.
  - Set a reasonable deadline for each task.
  - Commit ourselves to learn and study and practice more or at least the 30 hours recommended by HYF.
- **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team learned? This can be about anything, not just code!  

  - Working as a group and teach and learn together at the same time.
  - Implement Agile strategy without really knowing that we were doing it.
